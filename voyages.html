<h2>Hacker Sailing, with Mitch Altman</h2>



<p>This <strong>May 26th - 2019</strong> Astralship is going on a very special week-long voyage under the expert leadership of Mitch Altman. Deep in Snowdonia, we will go on a journey of deep-tech magic and innovation. The crew will hack together, learn together, have fun in the Snowdonia spring-shine and work on innovating some new systems that might help keep our civilization going.</p>

<p>The retreat is being privately organised for committed Astral pirates, hackers and makers. We’re going to go on an optimal deep-dive into the Astral with Mitch. </p>

		<h3>Where will we sail? - The voyage themes</h3>
		<p>This is your voyage. The ship will sail where the crew takes it and your unique skills and contributions will ultimately decide where we get to. That being said, we've decided on 2 broad themes and this time will focus our efforts on making something in these spaces.</p>

		<h4>Sustainable Technology, Smart-Agriculture and Energy.</h4>

		<p>We’re not sustainable and our planet is dying. There's a good chance the future of humanity will be decided in the next 20 years. There is not a day to waste, we alive at the time where what we do matters. It’s on ‘us’ to make sure we have sustainable systems and not for 'the system' to do it. There are many possible things we could work on. </p>

		<p>If we make something to support sustainable agriculture, we have the amazing Tyddyn Teg organic farm just down the hill who will be happy for site visits and to provide domain knowledge. The farm has been involved in projects like the Weedinator (robot from EMF Camp 2018) - another project we could link with. </p>

		<h4>Geo-spacial gaming for Health and Wellbeing</h4>
		<p>Let's take advantage of the beautful mountains of Snowdonia and get some fresh air. Using Arduino, wifi, GPS and some creativity we can design and prototype fun games to encourage players to get out, get fit and enjoy the mountains. </p>
		<p>We have an HTC Vive and GTX1070 Laptop, so some players could interact with teams from a mission control position or we could bring in other tech, drones?. Snowdonia is the setting for many tales from the Mabinogi, Britain’s oldest recorded folklore. Perhaps a fusion of old stories and new tech will capture imagination. Maybe there are NFTs to be traded or captured? Let's inspire the creative brainstorming here. </p>

<h3>Voyage Structure</h3>

<p>Silvia Bastos and Michal Korzonek are professional facilitators who will freely offer productivity hacks throughout the voyage. This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to increase their performance, not just on the Voyage, they're happy introduce methods for long-term personal productivity improvements. On voyage, they will subtly help participants optimise their performance both individually and as a team, helping the crew reach and maintain flow states, as well as maximise creativity and synergy. </p>

		<h4>Learn soldering and Arduino with Mitch</h4>
		<p>Everyone should know how to solder. Early in the voyage Mitch will run some sessions teaching how to get started building arduinos and learning to solder. Mitch will be on hand as we hack new solutions together, when technical problems and questions arise.</p>
		<p>This will be a intimate voyage, there will be time to get to know all the crew, including time to chat to Mitch about soldering or any other subject. Mitch has an enormous wealth of experience from inventing and manufacturing the open source TV-B-Gone to starting Noise Bridge and running Hack trips to China. </p>

<h3>Wiki</h3>

<p>Many of the details of the voyage will be organised dynamically via a wiki in the lead up to the voyage. Self organised sessions! Yes, of course. You will love the ambient spaces we create for intimate reciprocal learning on the ship. 

<h3>Dates</h3>

<p>The official voyage is <strong>26th May to 2nd June</strong>. There are also opportunities for hackers to come early to help set up or stay on to go deeper with Mitch. Get in touch.</p>


<h3>Cabin and Spaces</h3>


<p>Cabin spaces are limited on Astralship. We’re looking to fill 8 Cabins (4 single, 4 double) for this voyage to the future. We may also add some Hammocks or other sleeping spaces. If you want to sail on this voyage, the first of its kind, then get your name on the roster early to avoid disappointment.

<p>
Day Trippers: Hackers from the local area will be invited to join us for day trips.

</p><p>
No experience necessary, only a love of technology and a desire to see human prosperity.</p>
