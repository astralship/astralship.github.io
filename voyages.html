<h2>Hacker Sailing, with Mitch Altman</h2>



<p>This May 2019 Astralship is going on a very special week-long voyage under the expert leadership of Mitch Altman. Deep in Snowdonia, we will go on a journey of deep-tech magic and innovation. The crew will hack together, learn together, have fun in the Snowdonia spring-shine and work on innovating some new systems that might help keep our civilization going.</p>

<p>The retreat is being privately organised for committed Astral pirates, hackers and makers. We’re going to go on an optimal deep-dive into the Astral with Mitch. Liam and the amazing crew here will be working every day to make sure that everything is ready for a hacker retreat adventure like there never was before.</p>

<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>The ship will sail where the crew takes it and your unique skills and contributions will ultimately decide where we get to. That being said, we've decided on 2 broad themes and this time will focus our efforts on making something in these spaces.</p>

<h4>Sustainable Technology, Smart-Agriculture and Energy.</h4>

<p>We’re not sustainable and our planet is dying fast. It’s on ‘us’ to make sure we have sustainable systems and not wait for corporate capitalism to come up with them. There are many possible things we could work on in this space. </p>

<p>We're lucky to have the amazing organic farm Tyddyn Teg just down the hill from the Astralship. Which is where we source all our organic vegetables. The Farm coop members have a number of PhD between them and will be happy to provide domain knowledge. The farm has been involved in projects like the Weedinator (weeding robot show at EMF Camp 2018). </p>

<h4>Geo-spacial gaming for Health and Wellbeing</h4>
<p>We want this advantage of the amazing resources Snowdonia has to offer as much possible. With Arduino, wifi, GPS and some creative imagination we can design and prototype some fun games to encourage players to get out and make the most of the mountains and build their fitness. We do have an HTC Vive and GTX1070 Laptop at the Chapel, so maybe some players could interact with teams from a mission control position or we could bring in other tech like drones. Snowdonia is the setting for many tales from the Mabinogi, Britain’s oldest recorded folklore. Perhaps a fusion of old stories and new tech will capture people's imagination. Maybe there are NFTs to be traded or captured. Imagination is the limit. </p>

<h3>Voyage Structure</h3>

<p>Silvia Bastos and Michal Korzonek are professional facilitators who will freely offer productivity hacks throughout the voyage. This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to increase their performance, not just on the Voyage, they can also introduce methods for long-term personal productivity improvements. On voyage, they will help participants optimise their performance both individually and as a team, helping the crew reach and maintain flow states, as well as maximise creativity and synergy. </p>

<h3>Wiki</h3>

<p>Many of the details of the voyage will be organised dynamically via a wiki in the lead up to the voyage.

<h3>Dates</h3>

<p>The official voyage is <strong>26th May to 2nd June</strong>. There are also opportunities for hackers to come early to help set up or stay on to go deeper with Mitch. Get in touch.</p>


<h3>Cabin and Spaces</h3>


<p>Cabin spaces are limited on Astralship. We’re looking to fill 8 Cabins (4 single, 4 double) for this voyage to the future. We may also add some Hammocks or other sleeping spaces. If you want to sail on this voyage, the first of its kind, then get your name on the roster early to avoid disappointment.

<p>
Day Trippers: Hackers from the local area will be invited to join us for day trips.

</p><p>
No experience necessary, only a love of technology and a desire to see human prosperity.</p>


<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>Astralship voyages happen by magic, but there are costs and we need your contributions to make this happen. Single Cabins for the week, including a wonderful selection of Vegan food prepared by our resident Chef, are £450. Double cabins for 2: £600. We'll make sure there are few non-vegan options for those that aren't ready to make the switch and otherwise make the best advert for Vegan food we can with what we offer.</p>
