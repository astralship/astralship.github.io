<h2>üåé&nbsp;Hacker Sailing, with Mitch Altman</h2>



<p>This <strong>May 26th - 2019</strong> Astralship is going on a very special week-long voyage under the expert leadership of Mitch Altman. Deep in Snowdonia, we will go on a journey of deep-tech magic and innovation. The crew will hack together, learn together, have fun in the Snowdonia spring-shine and work on innovating some new systems that might help keep our civilization going.</p>

<p>The retreat is being privately organised for committed Astral pirates, hackers and makers. We‚Äôre going to go on max-creative peak-performance deep-dive into the Astral with Mitch. </p>

		<h3>Where will we sail? - The voyage themes</h3>
		<p>This is your voyage. The ship will sail where the crew takes it and your unique skills and contributions will ultimately decide where we get to. That being said, we've decided on 2 broad themes and this time will focus our efforts on making something in these spaces.</p>

		<h4>Sustainable Technology, Smart-Agriculture and Energy.</h4>

		<p>We‚Äôre not sustainable and our planet is dying. There's a good chance the future of humanity will be decided in the next 20 years. There is not a day to waste, we alive at the time where what we do matters. It‚Äôs on ‚Äòus‚Äô to make sure we have sustainable systems and not for 'the system' to do it. There are many possible things we could work on. </p>

		<p>If we make something to support sustainable agriculture, we have the amazing Tyddyn Teg organic farm just down the hill who will be happy for site visits and to provide domain knowledge. The farm has been involved in projects like the Weedinator (robot from EMF Camp 2018) - another project we could link with. </p>

		<h4>Geo-spacial gaming for Health and Wellbeing</h4>
		<p>Let's take advantage of the beautful mountains of Snowdonia and get some fresh air. Using Arduino, wifi, GPS and some creativity we can design and prototype fun games to encourage players to get out, get fit and enjoy the mountains. </p>
		<p>There's an HTC Vive + GTX1070 Laptop on board, so some we could have a mission control in VR or bring in other tech, drone-lovers? Snowdonia is the setting for many tales from the Mabinogi, Britain‚Äôs oldest folklore. Perhaps a fusion of old stories and new tech will capture imagination. Maybe there are NFTs to be traded or captured? We'll inspire some creative brainstorming. </p>

<h3>üåç&nbsp;Voyage Structure</h3>

<p>Sailing is an agile response to wind and weather to reach a destination. For our voyage we co-produce a structure, together with the emerging crew so produce a voyage lets us get to paradise island of the kind of creative interactive learning adventure that Astralship can uniquely produce.</p>
<br>
<section class="spotlight3">
	<div class="image"><img src="images/facilitators.png"  alt="" /></div>
	<div class="content">
		<h4>Facilitators on board.</h4>
		<p>Silvia Bastos and Michal Korzonek are professional facilitators who will freely offer productivity hacks throughout the voyage to all who are intersted. This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to increase their performance, not just on the Voyage but in daily life. Just check in with them anytime, they're happy introduce methods for long-term personal productivity improvements and development. On voyage, they will subtly help participants optimise their performance both individually and as a team, helping the crew reach and maintain flow states, as well as maximising our creativity and synergy. </p>

		<h4>Learn soldering and Arduino with Mitch</h4>
		<p>Everyone should know how to solder. Early in the voyage Mitch will run some sessions teaching how to get started building arduinos and learning to solder. Mitch will be on hand as we hack new solutions together, when technical problems and questions arise.</p>
		<p>There will be plenty of time to get to know all the crew, including time to chat to Mitch about soldering or any subject. Mitch has an enormous wealth of experience from inventing and manufacturing the open source TV-B-Gone to starting Noise Bridge and running Hacker trips to China. </p>

	<div class="content">
		<h4>Activities</h4>
		<p>There are some great options for other activities. Peak performance comes when mind, body and spirit are in optimal condition and regular breaks for soldering and staring at screens are a good idea</p>
		<p>There's already some Yoga practitioners signed up for the voyage, and there'll be a daily yoga session that anyone can join in. We'll have social evenings, with music (do we all love psy-bass?). Whether to test out some prototype devices or just to get out and explore Snowdonia, we'll get find some magic spots in the mountains.</p>

<h3>Wiki</h3>

<p>Many of the details of the voyage will be organised dynamically via a wiki in the lead up to the voyage. Self organised sessions! Yes, of course. You will love the ambient spaces we create for intimate reciprocal learning on the ship. 

<h3>Dates</h3>

<p>The official voyage is <strong>26th May to 2nd June</strong>. There are also opportunities for hackers to come early to help set up or stay on to go deeper with Mitch. Get in touch.</p>


<h3>Cabin and Spaces</h3>


<p>Cabin spaces are limited on Astralship. We‚Äôre looking to fill 8 Cabins (4 single, 4 double) for this voyage to the future. We may also add some Hammocks or other sleeping spaces. If you want to sail on this voyage, the first of its kind, then get your name on the roster early to avoid disappointment.

<p>
Day Trippers: Hackers from the local area will be invited to join us for day trips.

</p><p>
No experience necessary, only a love of technology and a desire to see human prosperity.</p>


<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>Astralship voyages do happen by magic, but there are physical costs and we need your contributions to make this happen. Single Cabins for the week, including a wonderful selection of Vegan food prepared by our resident Chef, are ¬£450. Double cabins for 2: ¬£600. Non-cabin spaces (very limited) ¬£250. </p>
<p><em>We'll make sure there are few non-vegan options for those that aren't ready to make the switch and otherwise make the best advert for Vegan food we can with what we offer.</em></p>
