	<h3>The next event will be announced here</h3>

	<p>For our launch event we used Eventbrite and Facebook. We are not big fans of Facebook but we did it anyway... For the next event we will be launching our own membership platform. Because software development takes longer than expected - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law">Hofstadter's_law</a> - that is why resolving to a temporary email signup... Once we are done with development you'll be very first to get onboard.</p>

	    </div>
	</form>
	</div>

	<p>We know it is not ideal - we have limited resources and we need to prioritise ruthlessly - see also <a href="jobs.html">jobs</a> to see what type of people we are recruiting. If you have any questions - see <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> or <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly... We are on the <a href="mission.html">mission</a>, we are here to stay and your support is always greatly appreciated.</p>

	<p>The basic functionality of the platform is ready maybe we should rollout it anyway?</p>



	<h3>Thank you for an amazing time</h3>

	<p>This party wouldn't be possible without you! Thank you very much for coming, the next event will be very special too...</p>

	<p>The initial event was a success - we gathered initial supporters - we've found commited people - we managed to get done many things on budget and on schedule. We intend to run regular events as a way of earning social capital and gathering momentum. Having a clear deadline and knowing that people are counting on us - it enforces some motivational pressure and we are ready for it...</p>
