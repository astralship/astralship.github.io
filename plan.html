<h3>"You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sails."</h3>
<p>The Astralship is an agile entity, we will adapt to an ever changing situation and adjust our course as needed to reach our goals. These are complex uncertain times and no one can be really sure how things will turn out. Agility however is no excuse for not having a plan at all. In 2017 we started preparing to launch an ICO based on only having an idea and a building. The market at the time was generally ready to fund wild proposals, however as things unfolded we changed our plan. We're in for the long haul and decided as a team we were not ready to take on a no-KYC/AML ICO.
</p>

<p>Before the ICO idea we were considering going for a kickstarter. Now the market is much more saturate with ICOs so that's probably not such an option for us, however we are considering returning to a kickstarter. What do you think? Have your say in via this <a src="https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Should-Astralship-org-launch-a-Kickstarter-or-an-ICO">Quora question</a>. </p>

<p>We've also considered raising money from private investors. The problem here is that it we would probably lock ourselves down to a particular course in order to satisfy a particular investor, who maybe looking for specific returns and would likely diminish our chance of achieving our primary goals. These are:

<ul>
	<li>Facilitate teams (and sometimes individuals) to achieve unparalleled peak-performance and creativity for the benefit of all.</li>
	<li>Provide a social and economics network that allows talented people to live well, while doing what they love, without compromising their beliefs or selling the rest of us down the river.</li>
</ul>
</p>





<h3>Where does this leave us?</h3>

<p><em>Develop revenue and grow organically till a better plan emerges!</em></p>
By keeping our costs low we can continue to bootstrap organically. Yes, it would be nice to have a big pile of cash to upgrade the ship, for now however we value our freedom above all else. 
<br><br>
<h3>What revenue streams are availabe?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>AirBnb</li>
	<p> Yes, our humble abode is available on AirBnB. It may not be a rocketship to success but a little income goes a long way in keeping us afloat. So far we have rave review, so this at least is some validation of our accommodation.</p>

	<li>Co-working</li>

	<p>Astralship is a beautiful place to hangout and work. It's also very cheap. For individuals or small teams that need to get away from the city and get some serious work done there's no better place. While our goal is to facilitate team voyages where everyone on voyage is collaborating, we're also open to calendaring in coworking time when anyone can come and live and work on the ship on a daily rate. For Â£30 /day we can provide a room, 3 meals and use of the internet and office. This charge may rise in time, but we will offer discounts to those working on ethical projects.</p>


	<li>Voyage Facilitation</li>
	<p> Voyages are what we're about and we're ready to sail. If you have a team that would like to spend some time on our ship working towards your goals please get in touch. We will demonstrate benchmark our success and clearly demonstrate the benefits of teams working on Astralship. For now we really need to prove ourselves and are ready to offer heavily discounted rates. While your working on a voyage it's really easy to add some media coverage and document your work, or go on team building excursions for very little extra cost.</p>

	<li>Solutions Consultancy</li>
	<p>We have lot of experience of running software and technology projects, and are happy to work with you to put together a team for almost anything. Drop us a line, we can discuss what you want to achieve and may be able to put together a proposal for how Astralship can get you there. Consider us an a-team of tech wizards and innovation pirates. </p>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Tokenise Innovation and Rennovation</h3>

<p>While we're continuously improving our ship and building our network of planet pirates, we are looking at different ways we can use blockchain so support the new paradigm socio-economic systems we want to create. There are 2 main things we're looking at. i) Tokenise and pre-sell future services on the ship(s). This approach allows us to raise investment to renovate the ship. ii) Allow pirates to contribute their time and energy for tokens and use smart contracts such that value generated in future voyages rewards token holders. You might one day be very glad you have a big bag of Astral coins. We're not ready to launch this yet, but keep an eye out.
