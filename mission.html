<p>Our Planet Earth is not doing well, global warming is taking its toll and set to get <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/">much worse.</a>. Technology itself will not lead us to sustainability, we require an intense will to develop and utilise the available technology to change our trajectory.  </p>
<p>Revolutions in human behaviour have happened in the past. Today powerful profit driven corporations funnel billions of dollars into psychology, marketing  and PR, their goal is to snare us in hypnotic spells that create desires we previously didn't have. We value and consume thing we don't really need, even as our longer term prospect become increasingly bleak.</p>
<p> Fundamentally we are all human beings, living for a limited time on our planet. We all have the same basic needs. We all want to protect ourselves and those we love. When we see the only way to really protect those we love is to protect our species and planet we will start prioritising what's really important and pull all our might into find ways to live sustainably. The spells can be broken. </p>

<h3>Realising human potential</h3>
<p>We know that what most of us achieve in our daily lives is far from our potential. We are building a space that is devoted to peak performance and enhanced creativity. We will achieve it through art, though facilitation, smart environments and psychology such as enabling the <a href="flow">flow state</a>. We're building a magical space with a creative intensity that helps us remove our self-limiting beliefs. We give our crews their own ship and the ability and freedom to sail to anywhere they will. Together we intend to sail to a new world, a new reality. Incredible energy and creativity, channeled and grounded to manifest real world solutions. </p>


<h3>The Adventurification of Innovation</h3>
<p>Astralship believes in the possibility of a radical transformation in human behaviour and economy.</p>
<p>There are many projects and people working around the globe who connect with the same vision. We bring together visionaries to co-create in shared physical and virtual spaces. We bring together the brightest and the best who will sail together to fulfill their <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.</p>
<p>By creating a beautiful and inspiring space in a magical and ancient landscape, with the right facilitation and creative support, we are creating a vehicle of innovation that takes the innovators on a journey of solution discovery. By tackling hard challenges in this environement we have developed what we're calling the 'Adventurification of Innovation'. 

<h3>An Independent Pirate lifestyle</h3>
<p>All too often regular employment provides just enough income to a rent a home close to the office. There's the drugery of communiting to work at a job where the primary aim is keepi the boss happy. The boss is job is to keep the shareholders happy and shareholders general care only about the profits. These soul destroying routines are taken as inevitable. We work and then go home to try and forget and then spend them money we earn trying to make life bearable, probably at the suggestion of the enormous corporate PR machine. </p>


<p>Astralship is about changing this model. We’re starting with one ship but want to create a global network. Talented individuals usually know what they’re worth on the commercial market, they know where they really add value. Astralship allows individuals to come and work in peak-performance where they can add maximum value while in collaboration. For example a good software developer should comfortably be able to earn all the money they need in a year from 6 productive 2 week voyages. The rest of the time? Live how you want to live and enjoy being on this planet for the limited time you have. When we have more time on our hands and are freed up from limiting beliefs about what we should be doing, we quickly realise that the best things in life are free.</p>
