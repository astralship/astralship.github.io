<p>Our Planet Earth is not doing well, global warming is taking its toll and set to get <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/">much worse.</a>. Technology itself will not lead us to sustainability, we require an intense will to develop and utilise the available technology to change our trajectory.  </p>
<p>Revolutions in human behaviour have happened in the past. Today, powerful profit driven corporations funnel billions of dollars into psychology, marketing  and PR. Their goal is to control our minds, and snare us in a hypnotic spell that makes us desire thing we don't need. Through psychological tactics they persuades us to consume things that add nothing of value to our lives, even as our longer term prospects for our collective surival become increasingly bleak.</p>
<p> Fundamentally, we are all human beings living for a limited time on our planet. We all have the same basic needs. We all want to protect ourselves and those we love. When we begin to see that the only way to really protect those we love long term is to protect our species and planet, we will start prioritising what's really important and put all our might into find ways to live sustainably. The spells can be broken. </p>

<h3>Realising human potential</h3>
<p>We know that what most of us achieve in our daily lives is far from our potential. This is why we are building a space that is devoted to enabling peak performance and enhanced creativity. We will achieve it through art, though facilitation, smart environments and flow psychology. We're building a magical space with a creative intensity that helps us remove our self-limiting beliefs. We give our crews their own ship and the ability and freedom to sail anywhere they will. Together we intend to sail to a new world, a new reality. Incredible energy and creativity, channeled and grounded to manifest real world solutions. </p>


<h3>The Adventurification of Innovation</h3>
<p>Astralship believes in the possibility of a radical transformation in human behaviour and economy.</p>
<p>There are many projects and people working around the globe who connect with the same vision. We bring together visionaries to co-create in shared physical and virtual spaces. We bring together the brightest and the best who will sail together to fulfill their <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.</p>
<p>By creating a beautiful and inspiring space in a magical and ancient landscape, with the right facilitation and creative support, we are creating a vehicle of innovation that takes the innovators on a journey of solution discovery. By tackling hard challenges in this environement we have developed what we're calling the 'Adventurification of Innovation'. 

<h3>An Independent Pirate lifestyle</h3>
<p>All too often regular employment provides just enough income to  rent a home close to the office. There's the drudgery of commuting to work at a job where the primary aim is keeping the boss happy. The boss’ job is to keep the shareholders happy and shareholders generally care only about the profits. These soul destroying routines are taken as inevitable. Many of us go to work and then go home to try and forget and spend the money we earn trying to make life bearable, probably as suggested by the corporate PR machine.</p>


<p>Astralship is about changing this model. We’re starting with one ship but want to create a global network. Talented individuals add a lot more value to the economy than they get paid. Astralship allows individuals to come and work in peak-performance facilitates them to add maximum value in collaboration with others but without most of the benefit going to the corporate shareholders. For example, a software developer working on the right project should comfortably be able to earn enough to sustain themselves for a year from 6 productive 2 week voyages. The rest of the time? Live how you want to live, and enjoy being on this planet for the limited time you have. No need to spend everything to maintain a flat in London if you don’t want to be there. When we have more time to live and are freed up from our self limiting beliefs, we quickly realise that the only time is now and the best things in life are free.</p>
