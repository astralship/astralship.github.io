								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir, less than 10 miles from Snowdon <i>(the highest mountain in England and Wales, Snowdonia National Park)</i>. You can see the sea from the office - you got it right - mountains, hiking, sea, beaches in a single location.</p>
								
								<p>When tackling a hard problem, sometimes the best approach is take a break and get some altitude. Snowdonia - and it’s breathtaking scenery of mountains and seaside - is literally on the doorstep. </p>

								<p>3h15m on the train from London - not a bad deal for a total connenction with nature.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in the project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us.</p>
								<p>We are launching a crowdfunding campaign to get additional funds, gather momentum and gauge interest in our project. See our <a href="investment.html">investment</a> proposal.</p>
							</header>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-ship">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>At minimum we need a new floor, insulation + heating system, lightning, and individual rooms for the crew. We estimate we need around <strong>£25,000</strong> in <strong>phase 1</strong> to improve the existing prototype.</p>

									<p>We are architecting things in such a way that we can continue to build on and enhance the space in future. The money is coming from our savings, family, friends and crowdfunding, see also <a href="investment.html">investment</a> to see a number ways how we are generating profit.</p>

									</p>We're developing this plan now and are looking for architects, artists, psychologists, carpenters, builders and creators of all kinds who want to be involved. </p>

									<p>Read more about <a href="refurbishment.html">refurbishment</a> and <a href="jobs.html">jobs</a>.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-money">
									<h3>Affordable services</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is expensive and time consuming.  By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost, we can reach prototype stage very quickly and efficiently. See what type of <a href="services.html">services</a> we have to offer.</p>
									<p>While we want to keep our expenditure low we will never compete on price. We will use our unique edge <em>(<a href="flow">flow state</a>)</em> and deliver excellent value.</p>

								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-child">
									<h3>Early days</h3>
									<p>It's just the beginning. Everything you see is a prototype. Expect many changes. It's work in progress and by visiting our website you are alredy part of it.</p>
									<p>We are gathering funds to make a major <a href="refurbishment.html">renovation</a> of our ship, we are engaging in mini-projects such as developing our website, a <a href="kickstarter.html">crowdfunding</a>video and architectural design of the ship.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-users">
									<h3>A social enterprise</h3>
									<p>We intend to set up as a Community Interest Company in the U.K. We will use our profits to fund technology education where they are most needed, starting with our local community in North Wales.</p>
									<p>Specifically we want to enable local people to develop technology skills that will support the local economy in the future, create a local culture of innovation and support environmental sustainability.</p>
									<p>Following our <a href="mission.html">mission</a>, trust, honesty, integrity.</p>
								</li>								
								
								<li class="icon fa-envelope-o">
									<h3>An open invitation to sail together</h3>
									<p>We have big dreams and with your help we'll achieve them. If you like our vision please share this site to help us find others who might want to be involved. If you'd like to get involved and help shape and develop any aspect of this project and our crowdfunding campaign, please get in touch.</p>

									<p>You can also read more on <a href="investment.html">investment</a> and <a href="kickstarter.html">kickstarter</a> page.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-connectdevelop">
									<h3>&quot;Building Parties&quot;</h3>
									<p>We are inviting everyone interested in working with us to join us onboard. We alredy cleaned the chapel and made it ready for the crowdfunding video.</p>

									<p>We're inviting <strong>artists</strong>, <strong>makers</strong> and <strong>creators</strong>, people with skills or just enthusiasm who want to come and help us. Drop in at any point and stay as long as it is practical and beneficial.</p>
