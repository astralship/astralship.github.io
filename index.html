								<h2>What is Astralship?</h2>
								<p>Astralship is a project to create a visionary facility for <strong>Creativity</strong>, <strong>Innovation</strong> and <strong>Collaboration</strong>.</p>

								<p>We are leveraging developments in fields like Architecture, IoT, Psychology and Advanced Manufacturing to repurpose an old chapel in Snowdonia to enable teams to reach <strong><a href="flow.html">full potential</a></strong> and solve problems that change the world.</p>

								<h2>Pirate ships and Innovation</h2>
								<p>We are building a facility where developers, designers, makers, artists, engineers, creatives and future thinkers work together in <a href="flow.html">flow state</a> uninterrupted by the outside world.</p>

								<p>Steve Jobs said it's better to be a Pirate than join the navy. We like naval metaphors, so expect references to pirates, sailing, <a href="voyages">voyages</a>, storms, treasures and discovering new lands.</p>

								<p>Changemakers don't accept the status quo, they go out and make it happen. The ship provides everything a crew needs to go on <a href="voyages">innovation journeys</a>.</p>

								<h2>The <a href="voyages.html">Voyages</a></h2>
								<p>We are building a ship, but once built where will we sail? We have a number of <a href="investment.html">revenue models</a>. Sometimes we'll assemble specialist crews to tackle our innovation challenges, sometimes we'll lease it out entirely. The ship will allow the bravest and brightest to push themselves and expand their limits.</p>
								<p>Some <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a> will be very intense, lasting up to 2 weeks, and some crews will need specialist facilitation to reach their goals. On a voyage, start-up teams will design and prototype new products or services, work that might have taken many months under traditional conditions. No BS, no corporate budget approval for Q4 - getting stuff done like there is no tomorrow.</p>

								<h2>Stunning Natural Location</h2>
								<p>The Chapel stands on the slopes of Elidir across the valley from Snowdon <i>(the highest mountain in England and Wales)</i> a few hundred metres from the Snowdonia National Park. </p>
								<p>When tackling a hard problem, sometimes the best approach is take a break and get some altitude. Snowdonia - and it’s breathtaking scenery of mountains and beaches - is literally on the doorstep. </p>
								<p>After a hike in the middle of a challenging voyage, there will be a Japanese onsen style hot-tub to unwind in, and a hearty meal before the nexts day's work begins.</p>

								<h2>Let's go sailing</h2>
								<p>For now we are gathering interest in the project and looking for those who want to come on a journey with us.</p>
								<p>We are planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign to get additional funds, gather momentum and gauge interest in our project. See our <a href="investment.html">investment</a> proposal.</p>
							</header>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-ship">
									<h3>Building the ship</h3>
									<p>At minimum we need a new floor, insulation + heating system, lightning, and individual rooms for the crew. We estimate we need around <strong>£50,000</strong> to improve the existing prototype.</p>

									<p>We are architecting things in such a way that we can continue to build on and enhance the space in future. The money is coming from our savings, family, friends and crowdfunding, see also <a href="investment.html">investment</a> to see a number ways how we are generating profits.</p>

									</p>We're developing this plan now and are looking for architects, artists, psychologists, carpenters, builders and creators of all kinds who want to be involved. </p>
									<p>Read more about <a href="refurbishment.html">refurbishment</a> and <a href="jobs.html">jobs</a>.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-money">
									<h3>Affordable services</h3>
									<p>In the convential paradigm, getting a team together to work on ideas is expensive and time consuming.  By providing a ship which is able to sustain teams at low cost, we can reach prototype stage very quickly and efficiently. See what type of <a href="services.html">services</a> we have to offer.</p>
									<p>While we want to keep our expenditure low we will never compete on price. We will use our unique edge <em>(<a href="flow">flow state</a>)</em> and deliver excellent value.</p>

								</li>
								
								<li class="icon fa-child">
									<h3>Early days</h3>
									<p>It's just the beginning. Everything you see is a prototype. Expect many changes. It's work in progress and by visiting our website you are alredy part of it.</p>
									<p>We are gathering funds to make a major <a href="refurbishment.html">renovation</a> of our ship, we are engaging in mini-projects such as developing our website, a <a href="investment.html">crowdfunding</a>video and architectural design of the ship.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon fa-users">
									<h3>A social enterprise</h3>
									<p>We intend to set up as a Community Interest Company in the U.K. We will use our profits to fund technology education where they are most needed, starting with our local community in North Wales.</p>
									<p>Specifically we want to enable local people to develop technology skills that will support the local economy in the future, create a local culture of innovation and support environmental sustainability.</p>
									<p>Following our <a href="mission.html">mission</a>, trust, honesty, integrity.</p>

									<h3>&quot;Building Parties&quot;</h3>
									<p>We are inviting everyone interested in working with us to join us onboard. We alredy cleaned the chapel and made it ready for the crowdfunding video.</p>

									<p>We're inviting <strong>artists</strong>, <strong>makers</strong> and <strong>creators</strong>, people with skills or just enthusiasm who want to come and help us. Drop in at any point and stay as long as it is practical and beneficial.</p>
