<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">We are converting historical chapel from 1838 into a visionary space to realise human potential and heal the planet.</p>
 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A group of multidisciplinary experts, scientists, researchers, developers, engineers, makers, hackers will live and work together to solve actual, urging problems:</p>
 
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
	<li>global warming</li>
	<li>air pollution</li>
	<li>plastic in the ocean</li>
	<li>deforestation and animal agriculture</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(we do not need yet another food delivery app)</i></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Our ship will provide everything for the crew to thrive in the <strong>flow state</strong> and <strong>peak performance</strong>:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
	<li>Food</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Physical exercise</li>
	<li>Removing errands such as shopping, cooking, cleaning</li>
	<li>Enhanced oxygen, ambient music, visual clues</li>
</ul>
 
<p>We are fully utilising latest development in quantified self, home automation, IoT - our space is blank canvas and is awaiting your creativity. We started with the vestry - small building attached to the chapel. The main space is more tricky - due to historical restrictions we need to comply to strict regulations. Until we obtain significant funding we will keep it open, reconfigurable, flexible. See our <a href="/refurbishment">refurbishment</a> plan.</p>

<p>We are currently working on the launch of a new cryptocurrency in the partnership with <a href="http://asc.ai/">ASC</a> - <strong>Awakening Sovereignty Collective</strong> - and we are the very first place in Europe to accept new form of the currency <i>(think in terms &quot;own version of Bitcoin&quot;)</i>. New monetary system, new models of ownership and governance - we are on the cutting edge of the planetary shift.</p>
