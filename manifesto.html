<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">We are converting historical chapel from 1838 into a visionary space to realise human potential and heal the planet.</p>
 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A group of multidisciplinary experts, scientists, researchers, developers, engineers, makers, hackers will live and work together to solve actual, urging problems:</p>
 
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
	<li>global warming</li>
	<li>air pollution</li>
	<li>plastic in the ocean</li>
	<li>deforestation and animal agriculture</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(we do not need yet another food delivery app)</i></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Our ship will provide everything for the crew to thrive in the <strong>flow state</strong> and <strong>peak performance</strong>:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
	<li>Food</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Exercise</li>
	<li>Removing errands such as shopping, cooking, cleaning</li>
	<li>Enhanced oxygen, ambient music, visual clues</li>
</ul>
 
<p>We will full exploit latest development in quantified self, home automation, IoT - our space is blank canvas and is awaiting your creativity. We started with cleaning up the vestry - small building attached to the chapel. The main space is more tricky - due to historical restrictions and fire regulations, until we obtain significant funding we will keep it open, reconfigurable, flexible.</p>
 
<p>We are always looking for more people - have a look at our <a href="/jobs">jobs</a> page. At the same time - we are not everything for everyone - and we not attempt to be - visionary leaders and radical thinkers already resonate with us at the highest vibration.</p>
 

<img src="images/ico2.jpeg"><br>
 
<p>We are currently working on the launch of a new cryptocurrency in the partnership with <a href="http://asc.ai/">ASC</a> - Awakening Sovereignty Collective - and we are the very first facility on this side of Atlantic to accept.</p>
