	<h3>We create space to enable collaboration and innovation.</h3>

	<p>We believe that living and working in such an environment fosters innovation on unprecedented levels of productivity.</p>

	<p>Proper sleep, food and exercise are essential. Some people say <em>life-work balance</em>, we prefer <em>life-work integration</em>. We're building an environment that enables and inspires the best teams to produce the best work. We are consulting with cross-disciplinary experts to prototype and constantly advance the ship's design and implementation.

	<p>Crew on duty should be able to push themselves to the limits of their abilities, but when itâ€™s time for a break the ship provides fine cuisine sourced from local organic farms and allow the crew to unwind effectively ready for the next day.</p>

	<p>Sitting is the new smoking! Human bodies suffer from siting for extended period of times so we make sure our crew takes care of their wellbeing and have a lot of physical activity.</p>

	<h3>Meditation and sleep hacking</h3>
	<p>Set an intention before going to sleep. Let the subconscious do the hard work.</p>

	<h3>Meal hacking</h3>
	<p>We prefer solid meals - no snacking, no hunger afterwards. Using spices to add extra flavour and keep us warm or chill, depending on the weather outside...</p>

	<h3>Sun hacking</h3>
	<p>It's often rainy and foggy, so whenever there is Sun outside it's almost obligatory to get a healthy dose of vitamin D.</p>
