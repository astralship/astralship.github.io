	<a href="#ready" class="ready">We are ready, proceed to payment</a>

	<p>Maybe know a little bit about the chapel, if not the <a href="/">main page</a> and <a href="mission">mission</a> are good places to start.</p>


	<h3>Holding company</h3>
	<p>We intend to create a Social Enterprise holding company that owns the chapel and will also own a portion of equity in each spin-off company we create.</p>
	

	<h3>Individual contributors</h3>
	<p>While we are in the initial stages of development we are unable to pay full market rates for professional services. Therefore we offer equity compensation and here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A03W2KHrGQvoU1AELQbG63J4myAEaNVag0w0SGuyx_o/edit">Google Doc</a> with &quot;back of a napkin&quot; calculation of what we have to offer. See also <a href="jobs">jobs</a> that are required.</p>

	<h3>Kickstarter </h3>
	<p>We will use a crowdfunding platform to raise money for the project. In addition to extra funding, this will allow us to guage interest in our project and make waves in real life and cyberspace. Developing the campaign video is one of our first <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>We're still working on the details of the campaign and exact reward structure</strong>, for now we've give an outline of what this might look like below and would love to hear your feedback. If you like what we're doing and are able to contribute some funds now, we love you. We'll promise you an early bird incentive and extra 20% your contribution when the campaign launches as a special thank you. The intention is to capitalise on traffic and early interest even before the Kickstarter is live.</p>

	<p><em>Note: At the moment we think we'll go with Kickstarter as the platform, it's Public Benefit Corporation and a lot of people are already signed up and have their payment details on the file. Let us know if you have an opinion on this.</em></p>

	<p>Here are some rewards we're considering at the moment:</p>

	<ul class="margin">
		<li>£1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>

	</ul>

	</ul>

	<p>We have a number of other options for raising funds:</p>
	<h3>Borrowing</h3>
	<p>We are evaluating obtaining a commercial mortgage on the Chapel.</p>

	<h3>Our own cash</h3>
	<p>I have savings, you have savings, we can probably find a few other individuals interested in investing too.</p>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p>There are some other potential revenue streams in our business plan:</p>
	<h3>Spinout businesses</h3>
	<p>Once we have an Astralship we're keen to demonstrate what we can do with it. We'll create products, websites, apps, designs, and prototypes. From some of these voyages we'll create be spin-off companies and these will generate income for Astralship. We're very interested in using future-thinking models of shared governance and ownership for these projects.</p>

	<h3><a href="stay">Hospitality</a></h3>
	<p><strong>Moved to a dedicated page.</strong></p>

	<p>The ship could become a go to place for digital nomads, makers, and researchers looking to work independently or with likeminded individuals and achieve states of <a href="flow.html">flow</a> which staying in one of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37754756">most beautiful places</a> in the world</p>

	<h3>Company Hireout</h3>
	<p>We'll hire the whole ship out to corporate clients when we need income and aren't using the ship. Companies can use the ship from their own voyages (for which we'll offer facilitation), for training workshops or inducting new recruits</p>

	<h3>Retreats</h3>
	<p>The ship will be suitable as a retreat location for running residentual courses.</p>

	<h3><a href="services">Consulting</a></h3>
	<p><strong>Moved to a dedicated page.</strong></p>

	<h3>Equity crowdfunding</h3>
	<p>We're currently investigating SEIS, <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/">https://www.seedrs.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/">https://www.crowdcube.com/</a>. If you are an accountant, lawyer or any person skilled in navigating paperwork - please join us. We want to avoid costly mistakes on technicalities. We need you.</p>

	<h3>Council, Government, EU, Lottery Fund</h3>
	<p>These can be slow to move, constraining and require a lot of paperwork and management overhead. For now we probably want to lay the foundations of the project ourselves, prove feasability and apply for larger grants later on. We'll start by running independently using our own cash and the funds from the crowdfunding.</p>

	<h3>Visionaires, Philanthropists, Social Investors</h3>
	<p>We don't really want investors who are only interested in the bottom line. We are looking for individuals who believe in the mission and want support the project and participate in the adventure.</p> 

	<hr>

	<h2>We are together in this</h2>
	<p>See <a href="contact.html">contact</a> to join us. Trello + Slack + GitHub are essential for collaboration.</p>

	<h3>Replicate the model / Operating at scale</h3>

	<p>There is a number of reasons why believe the project is going to be successful. We own the place, we have planning permission and we are vital parts of various online communities. We believe that work that we do in Snowdonia will be used in other places around the globe.</p>

	<p>At this stage we are planning crowdfunding campaign that is achievable and realistic. Once we prove that everything works as expected we will be ready for much larger investments to acquire real-estate in other worldwide and European locations <em>(London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona)</em> - international hubs with access to creative talent.</p>



	<p>First ship in Snowdonia is to demonstrate that is not only economically sustainable but also a facilitates the highest degrees of human creativity, collaboration and productivity - see <a href="flow.html">flow states</a>. Once we've proved this we'll build other ships in exceptional locations around the world. We believe it's quite possible for a talent young creatives and developers to be able to travel and work on voyages without ever needing to take up a year in year out 9-5 conventional job to fund their way.</p>
