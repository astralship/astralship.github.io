<p> We want to release a token to allow all those who help us on our journey to share and co-own the value we create. We're not rushing to take investment from investors who are only intersted in getting a return as that could compromise our mission. However, we're free given donation will really help us and you could have a huge impact.</p>

<h3>EOS</h3>
<p>We're very interested in EOS as a scalable blockchain with the potential for mass adoption. If you hold EOS consider sending us some support. We are very lean and your tokens will go a long way.

<h3>ETH</h3>
<p>I may have problems scaling but Ethereum was the first programmable chain and is home to a lot of tokens. Share the wealth with bootstrapping pirates.
