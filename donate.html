<p>Astralship is at a critical stage. We've demonstrated some value, built networks and a prototype ship. We calling out to all who can, to help us by sending a small regular donation. You can stop the payment whenever you want and it can be for an arbitrarily small amount. Everything helps. Help us get to the next phase of development</p>
<p>Payments are handled securely by stripe and liberapay.</p>
<p>Contributions will help us meet our costs while we set up the next phase of the project. We are only expecting these currently from people who trust us, however it is out intention to be full transparent with you budgets in the future.
