	&nbsp;
	<p>Our world is unravelling: the climate crisis, ecological breakdown, fake news and political extremism are taking hold. Rather than despair, we work to build a better future. </p>

	<p>
In northwest Wales many significant initiatives are underway which aim to be low impact, eco-friendly, sustainability oriented, creativity inspired, convivial and spiritually nourishing. Lets bringing these initiatives together to collaborate and support each other.
	</p>

	<p>
You'll be invited to propose topics for discussion, topics like local food, renewable energy, technology, community education, myth, language, sustainable building, wellbeing, political action, peoples' assemblies, or anything else you want to talk about.
	</p>
	<p>
Things are changing; desperate times require radical responses. We have a unique and valuable local culture and landscape that can build a resilient local community to support the flourishing of future generations and have a positive impact on the world. Join us in this step towards greater connection, collaboration and renewal.</p>
