	<h2>Sgwrs Cymunedol - Community Conversation</h2>

	<p>On Sunday 27th of October (11am - 5pm) we're hosting a facilitated community conversation on local sustainability. This is an Unconference, or self-organised workshop in which you the selected participants will shape the conversation and action we take forward. The conversation will be facilitated by highly experienced facilitators from <a href="https://www.ouishare.net">Ouishare</a></p>

	&nbsp;
	<p>Our world is unravelling: the climate crisis, ecological breakdown, fake news and political extremism are taking hold. Rather than despair, we work to build a better future. </p>

	<p>
In northwest Wales many significant initiatives are underway which aim to be low impact, eco-friendly, sustainability oriented, creativity inspired, convivial and spiritually nourishing. Lets bringing these initiatives together to collaborate and support each other.
	</p>

	<p>
You'll be invited to propose topics for discussion, topics like local food, renewable energy, technology, community education, myth, language, sustainable building, wellbeing, political action, peoples' assemblies, or anything else you want to talk about.
	</p>
	<p>
Things are changing; desperate times require radical responses. We have a unique and valuable local culture and landscape that can build a resilient local community to support the flourishing of future generations and have a positive impact on the world. Join us in this step towards greater connection, collaboration and renewal.</p>

	<p><strong>Iaith Cymraeg - Welsh language</strong></p>
	<p>We (the organisers) believe that supporting and encoraging the Welsh language is hugely important to any regional movement. That said we don't currently have the resources to put on a bilingual event and the facilitation for this will be in English. </p>
