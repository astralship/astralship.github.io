	<h2>Sgwrs Cymunedol - Community Conversation</h2>

	<p>On Sunday 27th of October (11am - 5pm) we're hosting a facilitated community conversation on local sustainability. This is an Unconference, or self-organised workshop in which you the selected participants will shape the conversation and action we take forward. The conversation will be facilitated by highly experiences facilitators from <a href="https://www.ouishare.net">Ouishare</a></p>

The intensity of our times in the face of climate crisis, ecological breakdown and political extremism is increasing. It's tempting to despair at such unravelling. And yet it can also generate a sense of urgency: the time to act is now. Positive grassroots work is going on everywhere, including in northwest Wales. So far we, in this region, have avoided the worst. For many, life is ticking over as usual. But the times they are re-arranging.
	</p><p> 
In the bioregion of Old Gwynedd â€“ the Conwy Valley, Eryri, Ynys MÃ´n and the Llyn Peninsula â€“ many significant initiatives are underway which aim to be low impact, eco-friendly, sustainability oriented, creativity inspired, convivial and spiritually nourishing. Most operate independently. Our idea is to bring people together representing these initiatives to strengthen connections and look into ways we can collaborate more effectively.
 
	</p><p> 
With this in mind we'd like to invite you to the first Gathering of ARISE-CYFODI on Sunday 27th October at the AstralShip in Deiniolen. Topics that may be explored include:
	</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Growing Food</li>
		<li>Renewable Energy</li>
		<li>Recycling, Compost, Waste</li>
		<li>Use of Latest Hi-Tech</li>
		<li>Sustainable Building</li>
		<li>Electric Bikes, Cars and Transport</li>
		<li>Response to Climate Crisis (XR)</li>
		<li>Myth, Spirituality, Well-Being, Place</li>
		<li>Education and Children</li>
		<li>Conversation, Party, Play</li>
	</ul> 
	</p><p> 
We are convinced that a â€˜paradigm shiftâ€™ is going on, that desperate times require radical responses. Please join us in this step up to greater connection, collaboration and renewal. Time to Arise-Cyfodi!
 
	</p><p> 
Please let us know if you can come and if there are other topics youâ€™d like to include in the conversation.
