<h2>The Chapel</h2>

<p>Capel Cefn-y-Waun Welsh Calvinist Methodist Chapel was built in 1838 on the site of a former school, but later rebuilt in 1868 by E. & R. Jones of Llanwnda to the design of R. Davies of Bangor. It is in the Romanesque style, built from rock-faced snecked stone with buff ashlar dressings, and topped by a slate roof. The chapel is entered via a pair of round-headed doorways in the front gable elevation, which has three bays with giant pilasters, a pedimented gable, and Lombardic cornice and oculus. The central bay has a large wheel window of 10 lights. The outer bays have pairs of round-headed windows with oculi and semi-circlets. The side bays are of two storeys, with six bays of round-headed windows, slightly taller to the upper storey. The rear elevation has a Lombardic cornice and oculcus.</p>

Within the church is a fine ceiling with classical cornice, moulded panels and roses. There is a three-sided gallery with panelled front mounted upon iron columns with Corinthian capitals. The box pews form two aisles, in front of which is a panelled pulpit with heavy cornice and flanking curved stairs.</p>

<h3>Modern history</h3>

<p>The Chapel stopped active service in the 2000s, when i was almost purchased for £130,000 subject to planning permission being granted. As the process took sometime and the prospective buyer had a baby on the way, the sale fell through and the Chapel was listed for Auction in feb 2010. Liam won the auction and aquired the Chapel for less than the guide price at £75,000. Subsequenctly the planning permission was obtained and Liam has been rennovating both Chapel and attached Vestry. He was originially living in the Vestry when he started Astral Dynamics but in 2013 removed all temporary constructions there to install a permanent concrete floor. Since then he has been living in the Chapel while vestry rennovation continue.</p>

<p>After buying the Chapel and starting Astral Dynamics, an entirely bootstrapped software company, the whirlwind adventure began. In 2014 the company won £440,000 for a project to digitise patient records using mobile devices, this was turned into a seperate company in 2015. It was not always plain sailing and there were many challenges and lessons learnt along the way. In late 2015 Liam met Michal, and at the end of 2016 the decided to being collaborating on Astralship. Placing their combined vision, energy and experience into creating a powerful and amitious vehicle for Innovation Facilitation. </p>
