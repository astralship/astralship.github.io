<p><strong>2017-10-27 Update:</strong> We won an innovation grant to develop language learning in VR.</p>

<p>We're currently sailing. We have a paying project developing language learning in VR. We're developing a game for learning Welsh set in the magical world of Welsh Folklore. We've already had some amazing discoveries about the potential of this technology. Get in touch if you'd like to voyage with us. 
This is our maiden funded voyage under the Astralship banner. We're not looking to be 'another language learning offering'. We're going to create significant innovation.</p>

<p>As you can see we're going for a low-poly style with beautiful lightning. Paper textures will come later. The terrain is actual Snowdonia topology. </p>

<p>Our crypto token system is not ready, but that doesn't mean we can reward collaboration with more than cash. In fact, as of time of writing we have very little cash available and for most jobs we can only provide board, lodgings and a conversation about how we can take things forward. We believe there is handful on individuals out there that will sail on the core voyage. If you are the right person we are ready to welcome you onboard. If you resonate with our mission, believe in yourself and are disatisfied with whatelse is on offer you may be an astral pirate<p>

<p>We are multidisciplinary team and we operate in fully agile matter, based on meritocraty - right person for the right job. Sometimes, it's all hands on deck! Be prepared to do whatever is necessary</p>
