<p><strong>2017-10-27 Update:</strong> Innovation grant to develop language learning in VR.</p>

We're currently sailing. Developing language learning in VR. We've already had some amazing discoveries about the potential of this technology. Get in touch if you'd like to voyage with us. 
This is our maiden funded voyage under the Astralship banner. We're not looking to be 'another language learning offering'. We're going to create significant innovation.

As you can see we're going for a low-poly style with beautiful lightning. Paper textures will come later. The terrain is actual Snowdonia topology.
