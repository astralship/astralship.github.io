<p><strong>2017-10-27 Update:</strong> We won an innovation grant to develop language learning in VR.</p>

<p>We have a paying project developing language learning in VR. We're developing a game for learning Welsh set in the magical world of Welsh Folklore. We've already had some amazing discoveries about the potential of this technology. Get in touch if you'd like to voyage with us. 
This is our maiden funded voyage under the Astralship banner. We're not looking to be 'another language learning offering'. We're going to create significant innovation.</p>
