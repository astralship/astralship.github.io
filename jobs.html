<p>It means many things to use - first of all it puts us on the map. Not just a bunch of freaks living in a church but reliable business that can play "old system" game.</p>

<p>We are looking for <strong>3D VR artists and storytellers</strong> to help us deliver the project.</p>

<p>Food and accomodation will be provided, we much prefer to have crew living and working on site.</p>

<p>It's relatively fairly rather urgent - we are getting our act together promoting the thing, interviewing and hiring people...</p>

<p>For each role the way to apply is via <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page - email us directly with your updated CV, portfolio and short explanation why you want to join the <strong>astralship</strong>.</p>

<p>While we are in the initial stages of development we are unable to pay full market rates for professional services. That is why we are proposing <strong>equity grants</strong>, see existing proposal on <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/genesis.re/document/d/1A03W2KHrGQvoU1AELQbG63J4myAEaNVag0w0SGuyx_o/edit?usp=drive_web">Google Docs</a> - in a nutsheel it's 50/50 cash equity split, at a very fair valuation.</p>

<p>It may happen that responsibilities are overlaping - it's expected - we are multidisciplinary team and we operate in fully agile matter, based on meritocraty - right person for the right job. Sometimes, in the critical moments of the project be prepared to do something different and help the crew... All hands on deck!</p>
