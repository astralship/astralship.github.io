	<p>We will use Kickstarter to raise money for the project. In addition to extra funding, this will allow us to guage interest in our project and make waves in real life and cyberspace. Developing the campaign video is one of our first <a href="voyages.html">voyages</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>We're still working on the details of the campaign and exact reward structure</strong>, for now we've give an outline of what this might look like below and would love to hear your feedback. If you like what we're doing and are able to contribute some funds now - MAGIC - let's do it. We'll promise you an early bird incentive and extra 15-20% your contribution when the campaign launches as a special thank you.</p>

	<p>Here are some rewards we're considering at the moment:</p>

	<ul class="margin">
		<li>£1 postcard <em>(to get plenty of backers and boost visibility)</em></li>
		<li>Do we want such small reward? <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-1-Kickstarter-reward</a></li>
		<li>£6 meal on the ship. Redeemable when the ship is not on a voyage.</li>
		<li>£30 membership of platform where you can sign up for voyages + 1 free night stay</li>
		<li>£100 one hour of consulting session</li>
		<li>£300 the Astralship for 1 day <em>(yours to crew and command)</em></li>
		<li>£500 the Astralship for 1 day with Innovation Facilitation. 
		<li>£1500 the Astralship for 7 days</li>
		<li>£2500 the Astralship for 7 days with Innovation Facilitation</li>
		<li>~£5000 We'll assemble a custom crew using our team and selected specialists from our network to tackle your innovation challenge or develop your app or product. Get in touch.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Considering various per-hour or half day rentals. Considering hiring our crew to run workshops in your organisation. Note that renting the space may interfere with other activities so we will prioritise <strong>consulting services</strong> and working with other <strong>engineering teams</strong>.</p>

	<p>Here are some additional ideas for Kickstarter rewards thrown in, let's us know what you think of these:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A plaque built and installed on the good ship Astral</li>
		<li>Name each of the pillars supporting the upper gallery</li>
		<li>Design your own stained glass window</li>
		<li>"Design and build you own room on the ship"</li>
		<li>Your banner in VR model</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>We are ready</h3>

	<p>Of course one can never be too ready, but we achieved a resonable balance and we are fairly confident that value we have to offer will serve humanity.</p>

	<ul class="margin">
		<li>If you are at this point - we assume you have a decent understanding what <strong>astralship</strong> really is.</li>
		<li>We operate in a fully transparent (open-source) manner, see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/astralship/videos/244750819331592/">video on FB</a> explaining our tools.</li>
		<li>We are not lawyers, accountants, significant others - we are on the <a href="mission">mission</a> to heal the planet.</li>
		<li>We have a network of dedicated supporters and we are always hiring - see <a href="jobs">jobs</a> and learn about our cash / equity compensation model.</li>
		<li>We kindly appreciate all the financial contributions - money will be put to <a href="refurbishment">refurbish</a> the place.</li>
		<li>We hope this website is easy to use, in case of any question please <a href="contact">contact us</a> directly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Our promise</h3>
	<ul class="margin">
		<li>Always acting with the highest degree of trust, honesty, transparency, integrity - we invite to participate in all our processes - we operate pretty much in public.</li>
		<li>These prices will never get any cheaper - on Kickstarter they will be 15-20% more - after Kicstarter they will be another 15-20% more - you are getting yourself a very good deal</li>
		<li>Rewards and transferable (even if you are not based in Wales you might be interested) and redeemable till <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038</a> - across all of our future facilities - at first we wanted to say &quot;forever&quot; but 20+ years should be enough.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>If you are still undecided</h3>
	<p>We've created a <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/55763-astralship-kickstarter-is-live">Thunderclap campaign</a> - ability to use social media and create a massive blast... It doesn't cost a penny and can help the project a lot!</p>

	<h3>ICO</h3>
	<p>We are still evaluating alternative in the forms of ICO - Initial Coin Offering - read more on our <a href="https://github.com/astralship/wiki/wiki/ICO---Initial-Coin-Offering">wiki page</a> - the principles remain the same - investing capital into the project - only the form is slightly different.</p>
