<h3>We've been using various different way to communicate online</h3>


<h3>Discord</h3>
<p>We had a bit of a life on Slack but that's lost momentum so now we've just started a discord channel. If you're on Discord, help us kick it off: https://discord.gg/36BDGnB</p>


<h3>Email</h3>

<p>It may be old fashioned but email is still a good way to get in touch. Use the form on the mail page to send up a message and we'll get back to you.</p>

<h3>Zoom calls</h3>

<p>Saturdays, 6pm, UK time. Link to join: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/923513631">zoom.us/j/923513631</a> - if you are on mobile download the app, the website will guide you.</p>

<p>If you have an issues with the website - it is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/astralship/astralship.github.io">GitHub</a> - opening a <a href="https://github.com/astralship/astralship.github.io/issues">new issue</a> there probably works best.</p>
