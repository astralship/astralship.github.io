<h3>Real time platforms</h3>
<p>We've been using various different way to communicate online</p>

<p>For now, we're on Slack. This is our Slack channel <a href="http://astralship.herokuapp.com">auto-invitation link</a>. Drop in and say "hello" in #introductions channel...</p>

<p> We've also just lauched a Discord server. This is primarily intended for the Steemit community that want to work with us but all discord users are welcome. Help us kick it off: https://discord.gg/36BDGnB<p>

<h3>Conference Calls</h3>

See Slack for info on joining a call. 

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>It may be old fashioned but email is still a good way to get in touch. Use the form on the mail page to send up a message and we'll get back to you.</p>
